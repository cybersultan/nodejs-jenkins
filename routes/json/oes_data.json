Once delivered to the Ride Site, it becomes more difficult logistically to complete them and having them non-operational at the Ride Site doesn't provide any utility to the Customer.Trying to maneuver partially operational vehicles to support media development was slow and difficult.  Trying to develop or verify RCS and/or RSS functions with partially operational vehicles involved wasting time with temporary configurations and overrides for missing sensors, vehicle functions, etc.  Trying to complete vehicles while they were also being cycled was logistically difficult to schedule appropriate resources.Trying to complete vehicles at the Ride Site vs. at the manufacturing facility involved difficult logistics to transfer appropriate parts, supplies, and tools needed at both locations.",

People end up waiting for the current problem to be fixed before they can continue on their own work. We also see some shifts, especially 3rd shift, where we are missing support for activities that are expected to be done to maintain schedule.",

If an issue crops up, which is often the case in software development, we have to check if it is on the inputs/outputs to the software (drives, encoders, etc) or the software itself. Because we don't know the software works on a \"standard\" configuration, we spend a lot of time troubleshooting. This typically requires the support from all the major control systems (RCS, VCS, WACS/VACS), so we end spending a lot of money and time to check out a single part of the vehicle.",

This led to some failures during testing due to unknown causes, which had to be investigated and found, causing some significant delays in testing operations, which is costly and frustrating.",
